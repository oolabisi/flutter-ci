Note that you can withdraw your consent at any time, however such withdrawal of consent would not affect the lawfulness of processing information based on consent given before its withdrawal.


**What information we collect**


In the course of providing products or services to you or our client and performing due diligence checks in connection with our products or services (or discussing the possible products or services we might provide), we generally collect personal information about you.  We also typically collect personal information about you when you visit or use our website. We typically collect or obtain your personal information because you give it to us (for example, in a form on our website) or because other people give that information to us (for example, third party service providers that we use to help operate our website).  We may also collect or obtain personal information from you because we observe or infer that information about you from the way you interact with us.  In order to improve your experience when you use this website and to ensure that it is functioning effectively, we (or our service providers) also use cookies (small text files stored in a user’s browser) and web beacons (small graphic images that are placed on a website and used to monitor a user’s interaction with that website) which may collect personal information.  Additional information on how we use cookies and other tracking technologies and how you can control these can be found in our Cookies Policy, which is included at the end of this document. The personal information that we may collect depends on the specific services, activities or products we undertake but typically includes: your name; age; date of birth; gender; home address; email address; BVN; telephone number; other contact details; country of residence; passport number and other national ID numbers; employment details (for example, the organization you work for, your job title); family circumstances (for example, your marital status where you enter it in a form on our website or it appears in any documentation you provide to us); financial information (for example, your income, bank statements, where you enter such information in a form on our website or it appears in any documentation that you provide to us or authorize us to access from your bank and financial institutions); details of how you use any product or service provided by Renmoney; postings on any blogs, forums, wikis, and any other social media applications and services that we provide; IP address; browser and device type; user name that is used by you for one of our products or services; language; access times and duration; details of how you like to use our website or the interactive products, tools, other technology or services we provide to you or our clients; websites that you visited before and after visiting our website; details of how you like to interact with us, and similar information. The types of personal information and ‘sensitive’ or ‘special categories’ of personal information that we collect will generally vary depending on the nature of the products and services that we provide to you and how you use our website.  In some cases, the ‘sensitive’ or ‘special categories’ of personal information that we collect may include information collected as part of KYC and anti-money laundering checks that we must conduct before accepting you as a customer. In some rare circumstances, we will also gather other ‘special categories’ of personal information about you because you volunteer that data to us (for example, it appears in a copy of your resume/CV that you upload to our website).  In some other circumstances, the personal information we collect from you is needed to meet our legal or regulatory obligations or to provide you with the products or services requested by you.   
In some cases, we may also collect personal information about you indirectly from third parties including but not limited to:

1.  your employer;
2.  third parties such as providers of ‘know your client’ and anti-money laundering services which we use to help us meet our legal requirements in this area and to help us verify your identity where we provide you with products or services;
3.  background check providers which we sometimes use to verify your identity when you apply for a product of ours;
4.  third party service providers that help us to operate our website; and
5.  your banks and financial institutions.


**How we use information about you**

As part of this, we may use your personal information in the course of correspondence relating to those products or services.  Such correspondence may be with you, our customers, our service providers or public or judicial authorities with the necessary authorization.   In many cases, we also use your personal information to conduct due diligence checks in advance of providing products or services to you, and to process an application from you or a prospective client to receive products or services from us.  If you are referred to us by an intermediary or similar third party, we also typically use your personal information to assess whether to accept or reject your referral to Renmoney by that intermediary or similar third party.

**The legal grounds we rely on for processing personal information**


We are required by law to set out in this Privacy Policy the legal grounds on which we rely in order to process your personal information. We generally use your personal information for the purposes outlined above because: (a) it is necessary for our legitimate interests and does not unduly affect your interests or fundamental rights and freedoms; (b) it is necessary for legal and/or regulatory obligations or requests that we are subject to, such as keeping records in accordance with applicable regulations or providing information to a public body or law enforcement agency; (c) it is necessary to perform contractual obligations that we owe towards you, or to take pre-contractual steps at the request of you; (d) in some cases, we have obtained your prior consent. To the extent that we process any sensitive personal information relating to you for any of the purposes outlined above, we will do so because either: (1) you have given us your explicit consent to process that information; (2) the processing is necessary for reasons of substantial public interest on the basis of applicable law (for example where we are required by law or regulatory requirements to process that information in order to ensure we meet our KYC and ‘anti money laundering’ obligations); or (3) the processing is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defense of legal claims. The legal grounds for processing sensitive personal information outlined above are contained in the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation and the Nigeria Data Protection Regulation 2019. If you do not want to continue receiving any marketing materials from us, you may communicate this to us via recommended options.


**To whom we disclose your information**


We generally disclose details about you to professional advisors and third parties that provide services to us (such as IT systems providers, platform providers, financial advisors, consultants including lawyers and accountants) and other goods and services providers (such as providers of marketing services where we are permitted to disclose your personal information to them); competent authorities (including any national and/or international regulatory or enforcement body or court or other form of tribunal, where we are required to do so by applicable law or regulation at their request); a potential buyer, transferee, merger partner or seller and their advisers in connection with an actual or potential transfer or merger of part or all of Renmoney’s business or assets, or any associated rights or interests, or to acquire a business or enter into a merger with it; credit reference agencies or other organizations that help us detect criminal activity and incidence of fraud; and any federal, state or local government departments and other statutory or public bodies.


**How long we keep your personal information**


We will hold your personal information on Renmoney’s systems for as long as is necessary to fulfil the purpose for which it was collected or to comply with applicable legal, regulatory or internal policy requirements.


**Protection of your personal information**


We use a range of physical, electronic and managerial measures to ensure that we keep your personal information secure, accurate and up to date. These measures include:

Although we use appropriate security measures once we have received your personal information, the transmission of data over the internet (including by e-mail) is never completely secure.  We endeavour to protect personal information, but we cannot guarantee the security of data transmitted to us or by us.


**Storage of Your Data**
